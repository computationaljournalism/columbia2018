    "Computational journalism: Technology, Media and Democracy\n",
    "------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the term *computational journalism.* What does it mean for journalism to be computational? Over the last few decades, computers have become part of our everyday lives. They regulate and shape our interactions with the physical and virtual worlds. Organizations increasingly equate (though not without problems) \"data release\" with transparency. Sensing (sound, light, air quality) is cheap and plentiful, and easily deployed by the general public. Our actions online generate vast quantities of digital data. And, increasingly, computer systems exercise real power in the world through the insertion of artificial intelligence alongside or in place of human decision making. In all of this, we can find new ways to ask questions about the world, how it's organized and how it functions. But the keys to this new digitized kingdom are data, code and algorithms. The curiosity, the questioning spirit, you developed last semester in your reporting classes, finds an outlet in new and unexpected ways, mediated by data, code and algorithms. Hence, *computational journalism.* It is simply a response to our new condition of living in a computational society.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this year's edition of the course, we will be focusing on computational tools and techniques that, while not necessarily new, certainly achieved new prominence in the national election in 2018 and beyond. The vast networks of information that are created every day are simply too large for us to examine in their entirety. To get a sense of \"what's on,\" we take feeds from algorithmic recommender systems, we scan trending topics, we focus on information shared with us by our friends or people we trust. Recently, we have seen how these tools and strategies for directing our attention can be hacked. Our course is part of a city-wide effort to create new technologies, to look for new kinds of stories, that respond to this new societal condition, to these \"threats to journalism.\" The broad initiative is described [here](https://www.techmediademocracy.nyc/) and you'll see that there are six campuses involved -- Cornell Tech, Columbia University, City University of New York, New York University, The New School and The Pratt Institute. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the all-city class syllabus:\n",
    "\n",
    ">This course will bring together journalism, design, media studies, and technical disciplines to understand the various threats to journalism and media, and attempt to address these challenges using technical and computational methods and techniques. The free press, journalism and the media are some of the most critical elements of our democracy, but have been increasingly under attack by political and market forces. These challenges include: dwindling resources and support for deep investigative journalism; smear, law and technical and even physical assaults of media organizations and journalists; challenges to credibility and reliability including fake news and discrediting campaigns; and shifting business models and income sources that threaten both local and national news organizations and coverage. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the theme of our course. It is broad, admitedly, but we will be creating projects and stories that look at the interplay of technology and journalism. Here is a list of topics that your instructors have come up with together with others from the various participating campuses -- we invite you to add to or edit this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Supporting Investigative Journalism with Tech**<br><br>\n",
    "> **Credibility and Misinformation**<br><br>\n",
    "> **Defending Journalism and Media**<br><br>\n",
    "> **Monetization and Business**<br><br>\n",
    "> **Media Landscape and Media Literacy**<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we will cover a variety of topics that will help you in your journalistic practice, both in the sense that you better understand the media \"ecology\" you interact with daily, but also we will teach you to look to these systems as a source of stories, and even perhaps as a source of inspiration to build some kind of new platform to support journalism. These are topics that we anticipate covering, but this is a balancing act with 6 campuses.\n",
    " \n",
    "> *Trending topics and the News Feed.* How do different organizations identify currently popular topics? What's being discussed right now? We will compare Facebook and Twitter, assembling large data sets and providing you with both an opportunity to question how well existing algorithms function as well as build something different.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Algorithmic recommender systems.* Distinct from trending topics, here we look newsfeed analysis. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Fake news.* This term needs to be retired, but the concept lets us discuss the Fake News AI (artificial intelligence) challenge, network analyses to see how a fake news story goes viral on Twitter, and even have a wiff of \"bots\" to see the role that fake Twitter accounts might be playing in material going viral. We will implement \"Hoaxy\" and the underlying tools that classify a Twitter account as fake. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Network analysis.* We introduce and build tools for looking at networks that are activated by certain kinds of material when shared on Twitter. We will buy 10,000 followers and examine how many are bots and how they behave. We will also look at networks of news sites that are all under the control of a single authority. How do you spot the depencence and then graph the networks? \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Bots and botnets.* From conversational bots (deployed by the Clinton and Trump campaigns, for example), to bots that harass, to bots that \"join in\" and help spread content on a social network, to \"Google bombs\", we will examine how autonomous programs can be used to hack our attention.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Adtech.* We will begind with Facebooks's targeting abilities and then look at Google Ads and Facebook advertising as vehicles for fake news, for spreading viral content. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "> *Explainable AI.* How can we make predictions, algorithms, more understandable? \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn a variety of tools along the way, and our primary programming language will be Python. We will talk through how we came to this decision, but for the moment, know that it is a flexible language that lets you easily connect to networks like Twitter, assemble and analyze data from formal databases and the web, and build responsive services based on all these inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python from within this notebook framework. The notebook is an ideal way to address you journalistic and programming needs. Beyond simply commenting on what\n",
    "your code is doing, these notebooks are a legitimate authoring system that you will use\n",
    "to create (and publish) pitches and memos for this class. "

    "**Why we code**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this course is to introduce computation, broadly defined, as a tool for both finding and telling stories. This mean \"reporting on\" computation and its role in the world, as well as \"reporting with\" computing tools in pursuit of a story -- and any combination of the two.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When teaching computation (or any \"technology\") as part of a course, people often refer to \"literacy\" as a goal. For the most part, that term implies \"functional literacy\" -- do you understand how to use something? Can you write a program, say, to assemble a data set from the web? Stuart Selber, a professor of English at Penn State, writes about two other facets to being literate. After functional literacy, he defines \"critical literacy.\" Here are characteristics of a critically literate student.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Design cultures.* A critically literate student scrutinizes the dominant perspectives that shape computer design cultures and their artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Use contexts.* A critically literate student sees use contexts as an inseperable aspect of computers that helps to contextualize and constitute them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Institutional forces.* A critically literate student understands the institutional forces that shape computer use.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Popular representations.* A critically literate student scrutinizes representations of \n",
    "computers in the public imagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third kind of literacy is \"rhetorical.\" \n",
    "\n",
    ">*Persuasion.* A rhetorically literate student understands that persuasion permeates interface design contexts in both implicit and explicit ways and that it always involves larger structures and forces (e.g., use contexts, ideology).\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Deliberation.* A rhetorically literate student understands that interface design problems are ill-defined problems whose solutions are representational arguments that have been arrived at through various deliberative activities.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Reflection.* A rhetorically literate student articulates his or her interface design knowledge at a conscious level and subjects their actions and practices to critical assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    ">*Social action.* A rhetorically literate student sees interface design as a form of social versus technical action.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the standpoint of a journalism student, all of this might best be wrapped up in the following equivalences (shamelessly cribbed from Ian Bogost at Georgia Tech).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<center>**Digital Technology = Model of the World  = Argument**</center>\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In short, every piece of digital technology embeds within it a model of the world. You might think of this as the dominant \"use case\" a designer had in mind. The net effect is that some actions are natural, \"designed for\", easy, while others are hard. And this is the argument. It is the way that technology trains you to adopt its conventions, its embedded model of the world. You are led to do the easy things and avoid the hard things. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we will spend a great deal of time learning a programming language, Python. And yes, any given coding language has its own model of the world and makes its own arguments for certain kinds of practices (certain metaphors for actually writing code). But with a coding language comes almost unbounded flexibility to create. Unlike many of the designed systems we interact with, coding gives us the freedom to build, to imagine the world in new ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these ideas take on particular resonance with our theme, \"Hacking your attention.\" We are inviting you to not only investigate existing algorithms for computing \"trending topics,\" but also to try out your own ideas about how this should be done. In an age when people are arguing for \"algorithmic accountability\" and \"explainable\" artificial intelligence\", it's the perfect time to consider a reporting practice that investigates by building.

    "Python is a programming language created by a guy, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum). van Rossum began work on Python in the late 1980s and version 1.0 was released in 1994. Python now has a considerable development community and you can find important resources at the [Python web site.](https://www.python.org/) According to that site, Python is \"a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be applied to many different classes of problems.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Those problems include  string manipuation -- looking at the words or sentences in a document, say. Python is conversant in network protocols which means you can use it to access web sites and services -- this will help with web scraping or pulling data from Twitter.
