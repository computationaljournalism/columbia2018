The block ends at a line less indented or the end of \\[your notebooks' code cell\\]. If a block has to be more deeply nested, it is simply indented further to the right... There is another aspect of structuring in Python, which we haven't mentioned so far, which you can see in the example below. Loops and Conditional statements end with a colon \":\" - the same is true for functions and other structures introducing blocks. So, we should have said Python structures by colons and indentation.\" (Cribbed from the [Python Tutorial](http://www.python-course.eu/python3_blocks.php))\n",
